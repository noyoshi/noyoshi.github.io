      Hi! My name is Noah Yoshida and I am a senior Computer Science major at the University of Notre Dame. 
      I like working on projects that challenge me to learn new things, particularly in the realms of 
      natural language processing, open source, Linux, and programming languages. I like thinking about how to 
      create useful abstractions upon which you can easily write more powerful programs. I am currently learning
      a lot about both compilers and computer vision / NLP through my courses and research.
      <br>

      My current research focuses on how memes were used to influence voters in Indonesia's recent presidential 
      election. I am trying to create a system that can extract semantic meanings from memes, whether that be 
      the image data itself (image manipulation etc), or from the content of the image (text, people of 
      interest, etc). I am aiming to publish a paper in Spring 2020 with a graduate student I am working with on
      this project.

      I made this site to be small with no dependencies - while I do dabble in front end development, that is not
      something want to aim my career at. There are no font downloads and zero JavaScript imports. (This might change -
      I intend to have a slider for dark / light mode, and also a way to switch between Japanese and English, but I will
      do this all by hand with no imports or dependencies).
      <br>
      <br>
      I will be adding more here as I procrastonate homework, but until then, you can find me at
      <a href="https://github.com/noyoshi">https://github.com/noyoshi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-yoshida/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-yoshida/</a>.
